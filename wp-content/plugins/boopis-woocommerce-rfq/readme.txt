Turning your online store into a lead generating machine has never been easier with the WooCommerce Request For Quotation Plugin for Wordpress. As competition increases with everyone selling the same products online, merchants are beginning to use ecommerce stores as a means to generate inquiries for custom quoted products.

If you have restrictions from your manufacturer for published prices, this plugin in perfect for you to generate interest from potential customers, and turn them into sales. If you sell expensive goods that requires negotiating prices, this plugin will help you start selling online.

Turn all you products into quotable items or pick just a few and mix and match items that can be purchased online and items that need quotes. All you need to do is change the price to zero, and presto, you've got a quotable item.

Alernatively you can turn your products into quotable items based on product tags.

Once the users click the inquire button, they are sent to a contact form where the product information is automatically filled into the form and you can define the fields that the customer needs to fill in. By reducing the amount of steps your online users take, the better chance you have of converting them into customers.

== Installation ==
Ensure that you have WooCommerce installed. Then upload the contents via ftp or ssh to the file directory of your wordpress site under wp-content/plugins/

Once installed, change the price of the items you want displayed as quotable items to ZERO. You will notice that on the front end, your quotable item buttons have changed.
